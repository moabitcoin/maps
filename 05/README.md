# Writing PyOsmium Handler

PyOsmium allows us to work with OpenStreetMap XML and PBF base map snapshots from Python.


# Goals

- Be able to understand basic object types involved (e.g. Nodes vs NodeRef)
- Be able to compute metrics with pyosmium


# Tasks

- [ ] Figure out where to start a new coffee shop in Kreuzberg


Ideas: estimate supply and demand from OpenStreetMap for example
- existing coffee shops, restaurants
- office buildings, points of interests (POIs)
- nearest distance to existing coffee shops
- nearest walk time to existing coffee shops
