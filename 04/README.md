# OpenStreetMap tags

# Goals
- Learn how to use the available resources for tag analysis and usage

# Tasks
- [ ] Find a tag in OSM that you don't recognize
- [ ] Look it up in the wiki and read about how it's used
- [ ] Write a query in Overpass to find how many instances of the tag exist where you are
    - Tip: use the Wizard to construct the query for you; the query language is complex
